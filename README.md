# Live Song Requests Application

## Description

A mobile-friendly app that allows me to take song requests in real time built using the MERN stack. Filter and select a song, enter your name, and watch as your request is submitted to me, where I'll get an email and respond to your request in real time.

## History/Motivation

As a multi-instrumentalist, I realized that I was having a hard time playing in bands and getting gigs after COVID. It was hard to find a good group of people to consistently play music with. So, I spent a year working on my vocals and building a setlist of 50+ songs that I could go perform live - on my own!

Building this application was a practical way I could use my development skills in conjunction with something I love to do and get paid for.
